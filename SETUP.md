# Getting Started

Thanks for checking out this Messenger bot Source Code! In a few minutes you'll have a Facebook chat bot up and running.

To get started, press the __Install Service from Source__ button below the editor to deploy the functions that will power your Messenger bot. After that you can fetch your code from the command line with: 

```shell
$ lib get [username]/blackjack-bot
```

From there you can add extra functionality and redeploy with:

```shell
$ lib up dev
```
